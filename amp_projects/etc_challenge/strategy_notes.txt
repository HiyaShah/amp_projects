STRATEGY
The basic strategy is:

Have some idea of a fair value for each security
Attempt to buy the security for less than fair, and sell it at more than fair

Fair Values:
- between the best bid and best offer

---ETFS---
- contains different securities, which have known values 
--> multiply values by number of shares in ETF and add to get the fair value of the ETF

---NON-ETFS---
bond = 1000
others = take mid of highest and lowest selling prices & buying prices

Trading With Your Fair Value:
edge is the profit you earn from completing a trade 
edge = dir_sign * (fair value - order price)
where dir_sign = 1 for buying and -1 for selling

pennying:
sending a buy order for current best bid + 1 and/or a sell order at current best offer - 1

taking:
not worth it
